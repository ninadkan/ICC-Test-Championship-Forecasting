# ICC-Test-Championship-Forecasting
Understand and forecast how a series results can affect PCT score of a nation's cricket team and more importantly, answer the question: 
Did Australia chickened out of current series with South Africa, keeping an eye on ICC Test Series final? 

I did probability calculation and came to the conclusion that if Australia had travelled to South Africa, its chances of appearing in the Test Championship final would've been 26%. But now that its decided not to, its chances has increased to 46.67%. All this, whilst India's chances have been diminished. 

Here's yearning that India takes the matter in their own hand and win by 2-0 or 2-1.
